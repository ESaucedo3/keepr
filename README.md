# About Keepr
Keepr is a full-stack application designed for users to share and manage images, known as "keeps" with others. Each user has personalized collections called "vaults" allowing them to organize and store keeps. When a user finds an intriguing image, they can save it to a specific vault, creating a "vaultkeep" relationship between a specific keep and vault.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login system powered by Auth0.
- **Explore Keeps**: Search and view a wide variety of shared keeps.
- **Full CRUD Functionality**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on keeps and vaults.
- **VaultKeep Management**: Easily delete a vaultkeep to remove the relationship between a vault and a keep.
